Establish a UART protocol between PC and FPGA to perform serial communication. You can
write your own code for UART.

Design and implement a hardware (on the Basys3 board) to transmit data at the baud rate of 9600, 8
data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity. Also, at the receiving end PC need to be set with same
settings (using a HyperTerminal or Putty or minicom).

Important points to be taken care of, while performing communication the characters are sent in
their ASCII format.
